# Learning Goals

## Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
Focus Bear was created to support people with ADHD, Autism, and other forms of neurodiversity by helping them build sustainable habits and stay focused. It provides structure, accountability, and gentler guidance for people who struggle with executive functioning or distraction.

## What problem is Focus Bear solving?
Focus Bear helps neurodiverse individuals build routines, stay punctual, and complete meaningful focus sessions. It also benefits anyone who finds themselves stuck in doomscrolling or overwhelmed by constant digital distractions. The app makes it easier to regain control over attention and build habits that support long-term wellbeing.

## Why do you think this mission is important?
This mission is incredibly important because constant exposure to social media and technology has made it harder for people to concentrate or engage in deep work. Many individuals, especially those with ADHD or Autism, face even greater challenges with focus and habit formation. Focus Bear provides tools that genuinely help users rebuild their focus, add structure to their day, and improve their mental clarity.

## How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?
I personally relate to Focus Bear’s purpose because I have struggled with staying focused for long periods. When I used Focus Bear last trimester, I noticed a clear improvement in my productivity and mental clarity. I had tried other tools like Pomodoro timers, but the features in Focus Bear stood out. They helped me reconnect with my routines and feel more in control of my day.

## Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?
Yes, absolutely. I have often found myself caught up in social media, which affected my mental health and disrupted my productivity. Even when I tried uninstalling apps, it was hard to break the habit. Focus Bear helped me find a healthier balance by providing structure and accountability, allowing me to stay focused without feeling overwhelmed.
