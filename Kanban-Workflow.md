# Kanban Workflow Reflection

## Reflection

### How Kanban Helps Manage Priorities and Avoid Overload
Kanban makes it easy to see everything that’s going on at a glance. By looking at the board, I can quickly spot which tasks are in progress, which are stuck, and which are ready to be picked up next. The visual layout stops me from taking on too many things at once, because I can clearly see my current workload and focus on finishing what’s already started before grabbing something new.

### Improving My Workflow with Kanban Principles
Using Kanban, I can break down big tasks into smaller, manageable pieces and move them across the board as I make progress. Setting WIP (Work In Progress) limits helps me finish tasks faster instead of juggling too many at the same time. I can also update the board regularly so the whole team knows exactly where things stand, reducing confusion and making collaboration smoother.

### One Way to Improve Task Tracking in My Role
I could add short, clear descriptions and deadlines to each task card so it’s obvious what needs to be done and by when. This would make it easier for both me and my teammates to track progress and prioritise work without constantly asking for updates.

### Practical Task Update
When I checked the Projects tab in the FocusBear GitHub repository, the Kanban board was not yet set up, so I couldn’t move a task through the workflow.  
If the board were available, I would have moved a task from Backlog → In Progress → Done, updating its status as I worked on it. This would help track progress transparently, ensure visibility for the whole team, and prevent tasks from getting stuck unnoticed.
