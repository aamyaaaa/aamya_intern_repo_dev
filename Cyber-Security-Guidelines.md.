# Cyber Security Guidelines

# Reflection

## What Security Measures I Currently Follow
I use strong passwords, keep my devices updated, and lock my laptop when I step away. I also avoid clicking unknown links. However, I sometimes rely on memory for passwords instead of using a manager.

## Where I Can Improve
I want to be more consistent with using a password manager and ensure every account I use has 2FA enabled.

## How I Will Build Secure Habits
I will treat secure behaviour as part of my routine: locking my laptop automatically, checking links carefully, and regularly reviewing my security settings.

## Steps I Will Take to Secure My Passwords and Accounts
I will set up a password manager, enable 2FA across all my work-related accounts, and avoid reusing passwords.

## What I Would Do if I Suspected a Breach
If I noticed unusual activity, I would immediately change my passwords, enable 2FA if not already active, disconnect from the network, and inform the Focus Bear team so the issue can be investigated properly.


# New Cyber Security Habit
I will start using a password manager every day instead of relying on memory or repeating passwords. This will help me keep all my accounts secure and unique.
