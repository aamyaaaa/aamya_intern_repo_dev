# Competitive Landscape Analysis

## Apps Compared

## 1. What makes Focus Bear different?
While providing blocks and routine following, Focus Bear remains minimalistic and simple to navigate. Besides this, FocusBear also backs up the features with scienetific research which starts with making the mornings right and building up the productive day. Focus Bear also help with people with ADHD and Autism. Other apps do not standout in that. 

## 2. Why choose Focus Bear over competitors?
If I were a user, I would choose Focus Bear becasue it covers it all- From getting the mornings and evenings right to blocking social media and also helping get into deep focus. The other application do provide these features but no app provides it all while still keeping it all simple. Some of the apps like Tiimo does have more features but it feels overwhelming. The other things that stands out is having a bear for emotional support.

- Freedom: Various music options for focus session 
- Cold Turkey: More advanced blocking options ( eg: Blocking a specific youtube channel), 1 time payment (no subscription)
- Tiimo: Calender Integartion, apple watch integration

## 4. One improvement for Focus Bear
Add in the calender feature/ inegrate it with apple calender.
