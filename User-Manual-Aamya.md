# How I Work Best
I do my best work when I have clarity on goals, access to the resources I need, and enough time to understand the context before starting. I like having space for deep focus sessions, especially when working on design decisions.

I struggle when priorities change suddenly without explanation or when I have to start a task without background information.

# Communication Style
I prefer messages to be clear, concise, and actionable.  
If something requires discussion or quick alignment, short video calls work best for me.

The best way to reach me is through our main communication channel (e.g., Slack/Discord).  
If something is urgent, a direct ping or call is the fastest way to get my attention.


# Collaboration & Teamwork
I work best when communication is open and expectations are clearly stated. I appreciate teammates who are transparent about progress and blockers.

My biggest pet peeve is unclear instructions or missing context that leads to delays.

If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means I am processing ideas and will contribute once I’ve formed a clear opinion.


# Focus & Productivity
I stay focused through structured deep work sessions. Focus Bear itself helps me create a rhythm with routines and focus blocks.

Things that distract me include multitasking, unclear priorities, or interruptions during deep work.

The best way to support my productivity is to give me uninterrupted time and clearly defined goals for each task.


# Feedback & Growth
I like feedback to be direct and practical. Clear examples help me understand exactly what to improve.

When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is calmly and directly, with a short explanation of what needs to be adjusted.

I appreciate it when teammates share reasoning behind decisions, so I can learn and improve my thinking.


# Fun Facts & Quirks
One thing people often misunderstand about me is that I enjoy working in cafés or dynamic spaces—these environments actually help me focus better.

A fun fact about me is that I love brainstorming out loud and often come up with ideas during casual conversations.

My work superpower is breaking down complex ideas and turning them into clear small goals.
