# Reflection

## What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
My role is website development intern. I will contribute to the Agile process by taking tasks from the backlog or board, building features, improving the frontend experience, and making sure my work aligns with the product goals. My updates help the team understand progress, and my work moves tasks from “In Progress” to “Done,” keeping the workflow active.

## How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
My work overlaps most with UX/UI and the Product Manager. I rely on UX/UI for design details, user flows, and visual guidance. I interact with the PM for clarity on requirements, priorities, and expected behaviour. My work is later tested by QA, so clear communication helps reduce bugs or misunderstandings.

## Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.
As a website developer, I help turn ideas into working features. I am responsible for building, refining, and maintaining parts of the product that users directly interact with. My role supports the team by making sure features are functional, visually consistent, and delivered in small, iterative improvements.

## Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.
I frequently collaborate with UX/UI designers. I can improve our teamwork by asking clarifying questions earlier, showing progress previews before finalising changes, and giving feedback about what is technically possible. This helps us stay aligned and prevents rework on both sides.
