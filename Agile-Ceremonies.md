# Agile Ceremonies Reflection

## Reflection

### How Agile Ceremonies Help with Communication and Alignment
Agile ceremonies make it easier for everyone to stay aligned and avoid misunderstandings. Daily stand-ups help the team know what each person is working on, what’s blocked, and what needs attention. Retrospectives give us space to reflect and improve our workflow. Backlog refinement helps ensure we’re always working on the most important tasks and that requirements are clear. These regular check-ins keep communication consistent and prevent last-minute confusion.

### Most Important Ceremony for My Role
As a web developer, backlog refinement (or continuous prioritisation in Kanban) is the most important ceremony for me. It gives clarity about upcoming tasks, technical requirements, and priorities. Clear refinement means I can plan my development work better, avoid rework, and make sure the implementation matches what the PM and designers expect.

### One Change to Improve Team Collaboration
One change I can make is to consistently confirm my attendance before stand-up meetings. This helps the team know who will be present, especially if the supervisor or other members are joining. It reduces waiting time and makes cross-time-zone collaboration smoother.

### Additional Evidence: Stand-up and Retrospective Participation
I attended the HireUp user testing stand-up session, where each team member shared quick updates and blockers. I observed how structured updates keep everyone aligned and help identify dependencies early.

I also reviewed notes from a previous retrospective. The discussion highlighted how clearer task ownership and better communication can make sprints run more smoothly. It reinforced how small adjustments can significantly improve teamwork.
