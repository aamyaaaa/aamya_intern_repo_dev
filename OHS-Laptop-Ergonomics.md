# OHS - Laptop Ergonomics Reflection

## Reflection

### Equipment Changes I Can Make
I recenty made chnages to my workspace by adding an external monitor for  bigger screen and by adding an external mouse and keyboard. I can now potentially add in a laptop stand.

### Behavioural Changes for Better Posture & Less Strain
Even with a good setup, I still need to be mindful of my posture—sitting upright, keeping my shoulders relaxed, and making sure my feet are flat on the floor. I plan to take regular breaks (every 45–60 minutes) to stretch, walk, and reset my posture.

### Reminding Myself to Keep Good Habits
I’ll use Focus Bear’s movement reminders to make sure I step away from my desk regularly. I can also do quick posture checks when I start a task and after every break.

### Workspace Change I’ve Made
I have made a small chnage of havign perfect lighting when i am working. It helps my eyes.
